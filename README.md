# SMART-AI
The LVO-AngioNet system addresses two fundamental challenges in large-vessel occlusion (LVO) imaging—sparse expert annotations and highly heterogeneous thrombus appearance—through a synergistic integration of synthetic data generation and anatomically constrained reconstruction. It comprises two core components:
  (i) an Occlusion Thrombus Generation Framework (OTGF) that transforms normal head–neck CTA volumes into high-fidelity, pixel-aligned synthetic LVO datasets, enabling balanced, distribution-aware supervision;
  (ii) a cascaded occluded-vessel reconstruction pipeline that first detects candidate occlusion segments across multiple arterial territories and then performs fine-grained, topology-preserving thrombus segmentation within each region of interest
  
Both components are trained under a unified two-stage paradigm:
  .  Stage 1 (pre-training): Models learn diverse occlusion phenotypes—including spatial configurations, lengths, bifurcation involvement, and contrast-dependent visibility—from 10,794 synthetic LVO instances generated by OTGF using 5,377 normal CTA scans. This stage provides a noise-free, controlled environment for robust feature learning.
  . Stage 2 (fine-tuning): Models are adapted on a curated clinical cohort of 319 real LVO cases, bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap and ensuring generalization across real-world imaging variability
This hybrid synthetic–real learning strategy not only mitigates dataset bias but also significantly enhances model generalization, as validated in downstream detection and segmentation tasks.
