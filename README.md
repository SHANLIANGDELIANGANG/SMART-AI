# SMART-AI: LVO-AngioNet System

The **LVO-AngioNet** system addresses two fundamental challenges in large-vessel occlusion (LVO) imaging:

- **Sparse expert annotations**
- **Highly heterogeneous thrombus appearance**

It achieves robust performance through a synergistic integration of **synthetic data generation** and **anatomically constrained reconstruction**.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Occlusion Thrombus Generation Framework (OTGF)
- Transforms normal head–neck CTA volumes into **high-fidelity, pixel-aligned synthetic LVO datasets**.
- Enables **balanced, distribution-aware supervision** for deep learning training.

### 2. Cascaded Occluded-Vessel Reconstruction Pipeline
- **Step 1**: Detects candidate occlusion segments across multiple arterial territories.
- **Step 2**: Performs **fine-grained, topology-preserving thrombus segmentation** within each region of interest.

## 📊 Unified Two-Stage Training Paradigm

### 🔹 Stage 1: Pre-training (Synthetic Data)
- Trained on **10,794 synthetic LVO instances** generated by OTGF from **5,377 normal CTA scans**.
- Learns diverse occlusion phenotypes:
  - Spatial configurations  
  - Occlusion lengths  
  - Bifurcation involvement  
  - Contrast-dependent visibility
- Provides a **noise-free, controlled environment** for robust feature learning.

### 🔸 Stage 2: Fine-tuning (Real Clinical Data)
- Adapted on a curated clinical cohort of **319 real LVO cases**.
- Effectively **bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap**.
- Ensures strong **generalization across real-world imaging variability**.

---

## ✅ Key Advantages

- Mitigates dataset bias caused by limited labeled data.
- Significantly enhances model generalization—validated in downstream:
  - **LVO detection**
  - **Thrombus segmentation** tasks.
